        <text>2nd . the hotel was fully booked for regular rooms , so when i checked in i was upgraded to an executive floor , just for the room , not for the service . the hotel is just above a big shopping center with ok food , and a subway station which isn ' t the most convenient , but it will do . the room was clean , the service was ok , but definitely not something to write about either way , if you need a good hotel in HK , and Mongkok is your region take it , but only if they give a good price , i wanted to extend my stay but they gave me a ridiculous offer</text>
